How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way I have learned over the years to ensure that my code is functional is to test each block of code after a portion is complete as I am able to test 50 lines of code for flaws and errors compared to the 1k+ plus then have to go through everything and try to see what is breaking where, and this also goes with making sure that some code is secure as I am able to test any and all inputs from the user while testing the funtionally of that code as I am able to make sure that the limits placed on the input work and actually throw errors when they are supposed to.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I make sure that the user needs are written down completely so I am able to ask questions to make sure that I fully understand the wants and needs for the program then I start trying my best to meet those needs by programming each need by itself and making sure that requirement is met.

How do I approach designing software?

I have always sat down and really thought things out including drawing out the design as I have learned over the years that having the software planned out before starting can save a lot of time.
